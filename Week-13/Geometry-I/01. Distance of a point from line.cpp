/*
Suppose we are given a line ( ax+ by+ c= 0 ) and a point P(x1, y1)
Then, the distance of point P from line can be calculated as:

d= |ax1 + by1 + c| / root(a^2 + b^2)

a,b,c and x1, y1 would be given as input in this case and we can use inbuilt functions like abs(), sqrt() to evaluate these.

i.e., d= abs( a*x1 + b*y1 + c ) / sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
