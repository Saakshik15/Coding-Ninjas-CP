Various string matching algorithms are:

1. Brute force
2. Robin Karp algorithm
3. KMP algorithm
4. Z-algorithm


1. Brute force algorithm:
  In the brute force way to match the strings, we can match the strings using simple sliding window technique to find if string 
  p in present in string t.

overall time complexity for the brute force way is O(n*m) where n, m are lengths of string and since for every string pattern
we are finding the matching string in the text.

Space complexity would be O(1) since no space is being used.
